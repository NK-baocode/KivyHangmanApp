# HangmanKivyApp
Working off the python console hangman game I published, this is a test project aimed to learn kivy, app development, and publishing. The goal would be to develop a hangman game application, with a several different screens and replay-ability.

Players have 6 tries before they lose.

The initial and current version is playable, however art for the hangman needs to be added (current image is a placeholder)

Updated word list from previous game, removed small and wierd words
